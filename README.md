# Implementing-an-IT-Security-Policy

## Objective
In this lab, I will practice implementing several different functional security policies. I will use Microsoft's Group Policy Management Console to implement password protection and antivirus policies. I will also learn how I can implement multiple policies using a Microsoft-issued security baseline and explore best practices for a mobile device security policy.

### Skills Learned
- Implement centrally managed password settings in accordance with a password protection policy.
- Implement centrally managed virus detection and protection in accordance with an antivirus policy.
- Apply a Microsoft-issued Windows Security Baseline to enforce best-practice security controls for a Windows Server system.
- Implement a standard for mobile device security controls in accordance with a BYOD device policy.
- Define best practices for Acceptable Use Policies and Privacy Policies.

### Tools and Software Used

- Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)
- Activity Directory Users and Groups
- Windows Defender Antivirus
- Security Compliance Toolkit (SCT)
